# Netzwelt-assessment
This assessment was developed using various tools and technologies to make it efficient, fast and user-friendly. Here is a list of the tools used and why they were chosen:

## Frameworks
1. NextJS - NextJS is a React-based web framework that helps to build static and dynamic websites. I used it because it provides many features out of the box, including server-side rendering and automatic code splitting, which makes the site faster and more SEO-friendly.
2. TailwindCSS - TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style components quickly and consistently. I used it because it provides a large number of pre-defined classes that can be easily customized to create unique designs.
3. ChakraUI - ChakraUI is a React component library that provides a set of customizable UI components. I used it because it helps to save development time by providing pre-built components.

## Libraries
4. React-Hook form  - React Hook Form is a lightweight library for managing form state in React applications. I used it because it prevents unnecessary re-render on input change.
5. SWR - SWR is a React hook that makes it easy to fetch data from APIs. I used it because it provides a simple API for data caching and revalidation, which helps to improve the site's performance.
6. NextAuth - NextAuth is an authentication library for NextJS. I used it because it provides an easy-to-use API for authentication and authorization, which saves development time.
7. NextAPI - NextAPI is a library for building API routes in NextJS. I used it because it provides an easy way to create API endpoints that can be accessed from the client or server.
